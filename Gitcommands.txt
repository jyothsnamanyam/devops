create a repo in UI of github
in our local
git init ---- initializes a empty repo in your local, whenever you create ls -a , you can see a (.git) folder this will be responsible for all of your code everything will be present in .git folder
.git/hooks/pre-commithooks  --- it is responsibe for before action of git commit pre-commithooks will work and ensure no passwords or secrets pushed to github
git status --- to see what is happening in this repository
git add calculator.sh --- adding file to git
git diff --- to see the code changes in a file
git commit -m " My first commit" ---- commits the code changes
git log --- to show you list of commits who made this commit and author and with commit message
git push --- from local to push changes to git hub
Git workflow
-----------
git add && git commit -m "commitmessage" && git Push
Mostly developers create repo through UI and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/argocdproj/argo-cd.git
git remote -v --- to know the remote reference (which repo)
git remote add "https://github.com/Iam-veramalla/testrepo" --- to create repo using CLI
there are 3 options to downlond/clone your repo 
https--- where you need to provide password
ssh--- you need public key
ssh-keygen -t rsa
you find your key in .ssh folder (users/averram/.ssh/id_rsa)
id_rsa--- private key
id_rsa.pub --- public key
copy the public key and paste it in github settings->ssh&gpg keys->new ssh key
Diff btw clone and fork
Clone is downloading the repo into your local
Fork means entire copy/replica of repository by your name space
git checkout -b feature --- to create a branch
git branch -- to see which branch you are in
git checkout main -- to switch to main branch
using branching strategy you can isolate/separate development activities
git log division ---- to see division branch logs
git cherry-pick 8368593293935582923gf972j98 --- cherry-pick is used to merge specific commit to another branch
git log --oneline --- shows logs in oneline
git log mergeexample --oneline
git merge mergeexample --- to merge the changes from Mergeexample branch to main branch
merge and rebase both are used to merge the changes from one branch to another only diff is rebase will give you commit history in a linear manner
if you want the previous  version of commit code then
git reset --hard 2546657876hjeta46576642sd4
